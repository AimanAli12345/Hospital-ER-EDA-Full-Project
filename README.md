## Hospital-ER-EDA-Full-Project
## In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on hospital patients data.
## Goal is to identify, understand, unveil and analyse the data in detail so it can later be visualized using Tableau.

-- In this projects we performed EDA to answer questions like the following:
-- How many rows do we have in our dataset?
-- How many colums do we have in our dataset?
-- How many years of data do we have?
--  How much data each year
-- How many years of data do we have and what is the %age / year?
-- What date has the highest number of patients
-- Covert date column from "text" to "date"
-- What date to what date is the data from?
-- What date had the highest number of patients?
-- so highest number of visits in a day are 18 on 22nd June 2019 and 17th August 2020. 
-- and lowest number of visits i.e, 1 was on 7 August 2019
-- What are the unique values in patient gender 
-- Number of patients of distinct genders
 -- Percentage of patients of distinct genders
-- What is the average age of patients in our data set
-- Avg age for distinct genders
-- How many races do we have in our data set
-- Which race has the most and least number of patients from?
-- WHat is the distribution of races in our data set?
-- What is the average waiting time of the patients in this data set?
-- what is the maximum and min waiting time?
-- What is the patient distribution accross departmental referral
-- What is the%age of patient distribution accross departmental referral
-- Which department has highest waiting time?

-- THE END
